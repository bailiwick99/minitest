# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Using Checkmarx CxFlow Action

name: CxFlow

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel - this job is specifically configured to use the Checkmarx CxFlow Action
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on - Ubuntu is required as Docker is leveraged for the action
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps require - checkout code, run CxFlow Action, Upload SARIF report (optional)
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # Runs the Checkmarx Scan leveraging the latest version of CxFlow - REFER to Action README for list of inputs
